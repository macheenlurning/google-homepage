Steps:
    1) put main elements on the page, the logo image and search form
    2) place them horizontally
    3) do the navbar across the top
        + build content first then try to position it
    4) add the footer, similar to top navbar
    5) do as much as you can before relying on the dev tools or viewing the page's source code
    6) push project to github
